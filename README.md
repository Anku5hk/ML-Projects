# Welcome to The_ML_Workflow
Goal: Build cool Deep Learning, Computer Vision applications/tutorials while maintaining code explainability. 

## Image Processing
* [Image filtering](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Image_filtering.ipynb): To  blur, add/remove nosie, sharpen image.
* [Edge detection](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Edge_detection.ipynb): Gradient Operators, Laplacian of Gaussian, Canny Edge Detection.
* [Corner Detection](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Corner_Detection.ipynb): Harris, Shi-Tomasi, FAST Corner Detection.
* [Keypoints detection and matching](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Keypoints_detection_and_matching.ipynb): Using ORB to detect keypoints and descriptors, then match with other images.
* [Image Pyramid And Reconstructing Image](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Image_Pyramid_And_Reconstructing_Image.ipynb): Gaussian, Laplacian Pyramid and Image reconstruction.
* [Optical flow demo notebook[Extra]](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Optical_flow_demo.ipynb): Little demo.
* [Optical flow](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/optical_flow.py): Find flow of particular object. 
* [Dense flow](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Dense_flow.py): Find global motion, process is to track all pixels to estimate motion.
* [Bag of visual words](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Bag_of_visual_words.ipynb): Make BOVW features to train an image classifier on.

## Face Applications
* [Face & Facial landmarks Detection](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Face%20Recognition/Face_Detection_methods.ipynb): Using Haarcascades, Face Detection library, dlib.
* [Face recognition using dimension reduction](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Face%20Recognition/Face_recognition_pca.ipynb): Make features using PCA/LDA which are dimension reduction algorithms and then use a classifier on top to classify the face.
* [Face_recognition using deep learning](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Face%20Recognition/Face_recognition_deep_learning.ipynb): A more modern and prefered way using deep learning library for faces called Face Detection library.
* [Extract faces[Extra]](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/extract_faces.py): Extract faces from a folder just by running this .py file into the folder containing images using Haarcascades.

## Applications
* [Image Classfication using BOWV](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/Image%20processing/Image_Classfication_using_BOWV.ipynb): Use BOVW to classify images.

## Kaggle Solutions
* [Petals to the Metal: FLower Classification on TPU](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Kaggle%20competitions%20solutions/Petals%20to%20the%20Metal_%20Flower%20Classification%20on%20TPU): Image classification using effnets with Tensorflow.
* [Wheat Detection](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Kaggle%20competitions%20solutions/Wheat%20Detection): Object detection using efficient-det and faster-rcnn with Pytorch.
