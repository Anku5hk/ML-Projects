This resources are compiled of materials that I consider good and are mostly freely accessible to everyone. I hope anyone taking thier journey into learning ML/DL or other to have a smooth ride with top-class study material without burning thier pockets. None of them are affilated or anything. I'll keep updating as newer resources are build/found.
